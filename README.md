# tag-management-demo

A demo of Tag Management in OU Campus. This repository assists the following blog posts:

* [Pull in Files using Tag Management in OU Campus](http://www.jessclark.com/using-tag-management-to-pull-in-files/)
* [Create an A-Z Directory with XSL](https://www.jessclark.com/create-an-a-z-directory-with-xsl/)

## Setup

Upload the files into your OU instance and make sure the XSL paths are correct on the PCF files. See line 2 on `/pcf/subjects/accounting.pcf` and `/pcf/data/library-data-file.pcf`

Duplicate `pcf/data/library-data-file.pcf` to create multiple pieces of content. In OU Campus, add tags to each page 
that specify a subject. For the blog post, a naming convention of `library-database-subject` was used. 

## Demo

The Library site will use this when they launch so until then, please use [this demo](http://www.unco.edu/jesse/data-file-demo/)
